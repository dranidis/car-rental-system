# car-rental-system
## Exercise for OOAD students

The code in this repo implements all the necessary classes for the 
**rentVehicle(catId, custId)** system operation. It implements exactly the design in the 
sequence diagram in the diagrams folder.

You can execute the code by running:
```
mvn compile exec:java
```
You can run the tests by:
```
mvn test
```

### Exercise 1
Draw another sequence diagram for the system operation **returnVehicle(rentalId)**, 
where rentalId is the id of the rental of the vehicle that is being returned. 
Add the diagram in the diagrams/img folder and put the link in the DESIGN.md file.

### Exercise 2
Write the code in Java for your sequence diagram. Use the existing code as your starting code 
but feel free to make any necessary changes as long as the initial tests still pass.

***It is important that you do both exercises in order to see if  your design works. 
Change your sequence diagram if necessary.***
